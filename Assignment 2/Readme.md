###List of Programs
1. Write a program to take input in an array and sort the elements using any sorting algorithm by pointers. Use 'new' operator to create dynamic memory allocation for arrays.
2. Write a program to input 2D array and print transpose of the matrix using Dynamic Memory Allocation.
3. Write a program using function overloading to find area of a square, rectangle and circle.
4. Write a function called zero_small() that has two integer arguments passed by reference and sets the smallest of the two numbers to 0. Write the main() function to access the function.
5. Write a program using function overloading which accepts two values as an argument and returns the sum. Call this function from the main() function and print the results in main() function. Use pointer to function to implement this function.
